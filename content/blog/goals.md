If you really want something, don't bargin with yourself. Don't say you'll "do a little extra tomorrow" so you can take it easy today. Don't say you'll start next week after you just get done with whatever is going on in your personal life. People who make little deals with themselves don't win. Sometimes you have to be a tyrant. At least a little bit. No concessions.
