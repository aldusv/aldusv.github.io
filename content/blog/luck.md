Lucky people are lucky because they make their own luck. This phrase of course denies the colloquial conception of luck as the domain of happenings outside one's control, but the truth is that people who consider themselves lucky have a high level of agency, and that lucky is an emergent phenomenon proceeding from the life of a highly agentic, energetic person. When a person considers themselves unlucky, they are making a veiled admission to the belief that they are dominated by externimal forces to the detriment of their life- that is, that they lack agency,

In searching for a ceiling on the amount of agency one can accrue, one will die before they find it.

1. A person has access to as much agency as they are willing to seize.
2. To seize agency one must believe that agency can be seized, lest an outcome be psychologically relegated to the domain of 'bad luck'.
3. A belief in one's own ability to seize agency proceeds from energy and competence. 
4. Those who have drawn a large amount of factors from the realm of chance, into the realm of agency, sees better outcomes. 

To determine whether a person is lucky, you can simply ask them. A person of high energy inevitably seizes agency and gains competence, drawing more factors into the realm of their control. Though it is possible for a person to actively self-sabotage, a healthy person rarely uses their own agency to lessen the quality of their outcomes.
