# About Me 

My name is Aldus Verastegui, an undergraduate Physics student at Texas A&M University. My research interests are widely varying, but I have done work in computational physics, specifically in the field of nuclear astrophysics. 

I invite you to read my [blog](/blog) and check out my [publications](/publications) for more information about my work!

Use the `ls -lh` command

```bash
lsblk -d -o NAME,MODEL,SERIAL,SIZE
zfs import
```


Einstein wrote $E = mc^2$.

$$
\int_0^1 x^2 \, dx = \frac{1}{3}
$$

$$
\sigma_r(E) = \frac{2J+1}{(2s_1+1)(2s_2+1)} \cdots
$$
